This is a quick project I put together to see if I could use JavaScript to randomly select 10 vocab words off of a JSON list (arabic-test.json) and display them using Reveal.JS

All you'd need to do is drop index.html and arabic-test.json into your unzipped Reveal.JS directory, and then open index.html in Firefox.
