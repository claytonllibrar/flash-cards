This is a quick project I put together to see if I could use JavaScript to randomly select 10 vocab words off of a JSON list (arabic-test.json) and display them using Reveal.JS

All you'd need to do is drop index.html and arabic-test.json into your unzipped Reveal.JS directory, and then open index.html in Firefox.

Please note that it does need to be Firefox as many browsers won't allow the XMLHttpRequest() to pull from your local directory. I had intended this project to just be used locally, though, so if you have access to a server (local or otherwise) it should be easy to get it to work that way.
